# gym-rl

Multiple implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in the OpenAI gym environments.

To install:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To change what algorithms run in which environments you need to change the `config.yaml` file. 

There are 2 modes of running:

 - General
 - Testing
 
General is for trying one algorithm at a time in a particular environment, this is more for debugging and just trying out the algorithm.

Testing is for when you want to monitor the performance of the algorithm(s) which will then create a plot of each performance.

Pull requests are very welcome along with issues.

I have not tested the `atari` as I was limited with time and resources so feel free to fix them etc.

Hope this project helps someone out there!
